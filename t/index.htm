A special court on Monday sentenced Jharkhand Ispat Pvt Ltd’s (JIPL) directors RC Rungta and RS Rungta to four years in rigorous imprisonment in the coal block allocation scam that rocked the UPA-II dispensation.
Awarding the first sentence in the coal block allocation cases, the court also imposed a fine of Rs 25 lakh on JIPL, the offending firm, and Rs. 5 lakh on both the directors.
The special court had on March 28 held JIPL guilty of cheating the government to illegally bag a mining block in the state. The arguments on their sentencing had taken place on March 31, after which it had reserved its order on sentence.
While arguing before the court, Rungtas’ counsel had pleaded that his clients deserved leniency because the criminal charges against them were of an economic nature, and not of any heinous offence.
“We have already got the punishment,” added the counsel, saying that JIPL had not been able to extract coal from the mine and had suffered a loss “over Rs. 200 crore.”
In March, while convicting the company and its directors guilty of conspiracy and cheating, special judge Bharat Parashar said “the intention to defraud on the part of accused persons is writ large on the face of record”.
The court said, “It is also thus crystal clear that all the acts committed by the accused persons have been fraudulently done with a dishonest intention”.
The sentencing should come as a slight relief for the Rungtas as the maximum punishment for cheating in India could go up to seven years of imprisonment.
The coal scam that rocked the Manmohan Singh government came to light when audit watchdog CAG (comptroller and auditor general) flagged irregularities in allocation of coal blocks from 2004 onwards. The estimated loss to the exchequer initially pegged at Rs 10 lakh crore was later whittled down to Rs 1.86 lakh crore.
